Code base for the project: Motion Matching for Responsive Animation For Digital Humans.

## Getting started

We recommend [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for the development.
It is a paid software, but JetBrains has the [student plan](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)
that provides free licenses.
